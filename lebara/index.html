      Got loved ones overseas? So many of us do. And with border closures across
      the globe, thousands of Aussies have found themselves away from their
      families, their friends, and their homes. Lebara knows how important it is
      to stay connected and we are here to help you call your loved ones
      anywhere in the world.
    </div>
    <div class="visual-text">
      Our calls cross continents while we cannot, giving us the comfort of a
      familiar voice on the other end of the line. A simple phone call is often
      just the thing we need— and our data shows just how much Australians love
      to call. Based on Lebara’s call data, these are the most common
      international calls made in 2021.
